If you own a Mosrite guitar, or are looking to buy one, you might be wondering how to date it and identify its model. Fortunately, Mosrite guitars have serial numbers that can help you with this task. However, decoding Mosrite serial numbers can be tricky, as they changed over the years and sometimes had exceptions or errors. In this article, we will explain how to decode Mosrite guitar serial numbers and provide some tips and resources for further research.
 
## Identify the Model
 
The first step in decoding Mosrite guitar serial numbers is to identify the model of the guitar. Mosrite produced several models over the years, some of which had different serial number systems or locations. The most popular Mosrite models include the Ventures, the Celebrity, and the Mark V. Once the model has been identified, the next step is to check the serial number.
 
## Check the Serial Number Location
 
The serial number can be found on the back of the headstock, and will provide the date of manufacture. However, some Mosrite guitars have their serial number stamped on the fretboard between the 21st and 22nd fret. This usually indicates that the guitar was made between late 1963 and late 1968[^1^]. Some Mosrite guitars also have an assembly date and batch number stamped on the neck and in the neck pocket (bolt ons only), which can provide more information about the production process[^1^]. If your guitar does not have a serial number at all, it might be either a very early model (pre-1960), a replacement neck, a copy, or a refret[^1^].
 
## Decode the Serial Number
 
The serial number consists of a series of digits that indicate the year and month of manufacture, as well as the model and production number. The format and meaning of these digits vary depending on the model and period of production. Here are some general guidelines for decoding Mosrite serial numbers:
 
- For double necks made between 1960 and 1963, the serial number is a three-digit number starting with 1 (e.g., 101). The second digit indicates the year (e.g., 1 for 1961) and the third digit indicates the production number (e.g., 1 for first)[^1^].
- For single neck models made between 1960 and 1963, the serial number is a four-digit number starting with 1 (e.g., 1001). The second digit indicates the year (e.g., 0 for 1960) and the last two digits indicate the production number (e.g., 01 for first)[^1^].
- For basses made between 1960 and 1963, the serial number is a three-digit number starting with 0 (e.g., 001). The second digit indicates the year (e.g., 0 for 1960) and the third digit indicates the production number (e.g., 1 for first)[^1^].
- For guitars made between late 1963 and late 1968 with serial numbers stamped on the fretboard, the serial number is a five-digit number starting with either 2 or 3 (e.g., 20001 or 30001). The second digit indicates
the year (e.g., 0 for 1964) and the last three digits indicate
the production number (e.g., 001 for first)[^1^].
- For guitars made after late 1968 with serial numbers stamped on
the back of
the headstock,
the serial number is a six-digit number starting with either
4 or
5
(e.g.,
400001 or
500001).
The second digit indicates
the year
(e.g.,
0 for
1970)
